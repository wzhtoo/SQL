# SQL Answer

**Greetings!**

**Hello and welcome!**

    I'm WIN ZAW HTOO, the creator of this SQL learning repository. My aim is to make SQL accessible and understandable for everyone. This repository is a reflection of my journey in mastering SQL. I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. You can also practice SQL using this link below. I've provided solutions for all the exercises there. Let's learn together!

## Introduction

I created this repository with the intention of sharing my journey as I learn SQL. I believe that knowledge is more valuable when shared, and I hope that this repository will be a useful resource for anyone who is also learning SQL.

## SQL Query Example

Here's an example of a SQL query that finds the highest number of books read by a family member:

```sql
SELECT MAX(num_books_read)
FROM family_members;
```

This SQL query returns the maximum number of books read (`num_books_read`) from the `family_members` table. The `MAX(num_books_read)` function returns the highest number of books read by a family member.

### Join Me on This Journey

If youâ€™re also learning SQL or interested in databases, feel free to follow along and learn with me. Letâ€™s support each other on this journey of learning!

    You can copy this content and paste it into your `README.md` file. Remember to replace the SQL query with your own examples and adjust the text as needed to fit your personal style and the specifics of your repository. Happy learning! ðŸ˜Š
